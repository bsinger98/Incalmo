# @name: Experiment Config Defaults
# @author: Yusuf Saquib <ysaquib@andrew.cmu.edu>
# @brief:
# This file shows the setup for an experiment configuration file and the default values for each field.
# Some of the fields are optional, while some are required, and have been labelled appropriately with defaults.
# The file is parsed in the emulator.py file and the values are used to run the experiment.
# In order to run multiple experiments using a single config file, create a second experiment block
# with a different ID and place it below the first one.
#
# NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY ANY VALUES IN THIS FILE.
#       IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE VALUES, PLEASE CREATE ANOTHER FILE.
#       THIS FILE IS ONLY FOR REFERENCE AND IS USED BY THE EMULATOR.
